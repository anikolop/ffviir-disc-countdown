# Final Fantasy VII Rebirth Disc Countdown

This is a [blazor wasm website](https://ffviirebirth-disc-countdown.com) that displays a countdown of "discs" left until the release of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. Inspired by a joke by Maximilian Dood.

## What do you mean, "discs"?

It was [previously announced that Rebirth will be so massive, it will require "2 discs"](https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1666921455685369857). This was of course taken very seriously by the Internet community.

Then, in September 14, streamer Maximilian Dood shared his impressions on the release date for the game. He made a joke about [how discs are now a measure of time](https://clips.twitch.tv/ImportantCoyPeppermintKippa-UoYudqLJI0ceb10w).

Thus, the idea for this website was born.
